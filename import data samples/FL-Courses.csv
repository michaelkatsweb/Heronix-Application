High School Graduation Requirement in Science for Students Entering Grade Nine in 2014-15 or later:,
"3 credits in Science, one of which must be Biology I (BI), two of which must be equally rigorous (EQ) science courses and two must have a laboratory",
All dual enrollment science courses should satisfy the equally rigorous requirement; certain courses identified on this list will satisfy the Biology I high
school graduation credit. Dual enrollment science courses taken with a corresponding laboratory course will be awarded 1.0 high school science credit.
Dual enrollment science courses taken without a laboratory component will be awarded 0.5 high school science credits. Separate lecture and lab courses
may not be combined or the grades averaged for secondary transcript purposes. The lecture and lab courses must be listed separately on the student's
"Biology I: Dual enrollment courses in general biology identified on this list will meet the Biology I high school graduation requirement. However, courses"
"that are a lecture-only format, and are not taken with a corresponding laboratory course, are designated as Equally Rigorous and will be awarded 0.5"
"high school credit. *A district-determined (DD) subject area graduation code was implemented in SY 2018-19 and thereafter, which has been applied to"
Note: Two lecture-only format courses with similar numbers to those designated as Biology may satisfy the Biology I graduation requirement; students
End of Course Assessment: Students who complete their Biology I requirement through dual enrollment are not required to take the Biology I End-of-
"Course Assessment (EOC). However, students who choose to pursue the “Scholar” diploma designation must complete the Biology I EOC. The EOC will"
be used for the diploma designation only. The content in the sequence BSC X010 and BSC X011 or BSC X007 and BSC X008 are comparable to the
Social Studies
Course listed in this section shall be considered the specific Social Studies coursework for the purposes of high school graduation requirements as

Electives
Elective courses have been identified as high enrollment courses and are provided to assist in determining appropriate high school subject area credit.
This section should not be considered a complete list of courses that may be used for elective credit toward high school graduation requirements.
